    "In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.\n",

    "### Function Description\n",
    "Complete the solve function in the editor below.\n",
    "\n",
    "solve has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax\n",
    "- int tip_percent: the tip percentage\n",
    "- int tax_percent: the tax percentage\n",
    "Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
