    "### Objective\n",
    "Today, we will extend what we learned yesterday about Inheritance to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific object oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:\n",
    "- Inherits from Book\n",
    "- Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters:\n",
    "    1. string title\n",
    "    2. string author\n",
    "    3. int price\n",
    "- Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these 3lines:\n",
    "    1. title:, a space, and then the current instance's title.\n",
    "    2. author:, a space, and then the current instance's author.\n",
    "    3. price:, a space, and then the current instance's price.\n",
    "### Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "The void display() method should print and label the respective title, author, and price of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Title: title\n",
    "    Author: author\n",
    "    Price: price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: The &#36; is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Alchemist\n",
    "    Paulo Coelho\n",
    "    248"
